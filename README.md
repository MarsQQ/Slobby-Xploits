# Slobby-Xploits
An Executor that should've been open-source.

This Executor was a closed-source fork of BetterSynapse (and BestSynapse) released by Attack Titan to WeAreDevs and Reddit. 
This Executor uses Private-Use-Only APIs, KRNL's Monaco and ScriptBlox (whether the rights to use it is unclear)

All we can tell you is if you plan to skid off this project, skid off BetterSynapse & BestSynapse instead, and follow the GPL 3.0 License.
This project is only uploaded to GitHub so that it meets the GPL 3.0 License.

Please be respectful & thank you.
